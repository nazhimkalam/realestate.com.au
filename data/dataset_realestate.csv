,"On Another Level. Literally.","$800,000","Saturday, 4:32pm<br/><br/>The text thread's settled it: ""We'll meet at yours.""<br/>Flattering, until you realise you've got three clean glasses and one of them's technically a vase.<br/><br/>The living room glows with north-facing light, white walls, and those hybrid floors that make everything look curated. It's the kind of space that says ""together"" even when the laundry's still hiding in the machine.<br/><br/>The kitchen? Stainless, sleek, quietly confident. Gas cooking, dishwasher, more bench space than your current imagination allows. Maybe tonight it's pasta and candles, maybe it's takeaway plated up like you made it. Either way, it works.<br/><br/>Dinner belongs in the dining room. Four feels civilised, six feels entertaining. Add the right playlist and you'll forget the time.<br/><br/>Upstairs, the main bedroom is calm and ordered, robes waiting for whatever version of you shows up tomorrow. <br/><br/>Downstairs, the second bedroom steals the spotlight with sliding doors to your private courtyard. Perfect for morning coffee, late-night conversations, or golden-hour spritzes that last longer than planned.<br/><br/>The bathroom earns its keep: bath and shower combo, separate toilet. A retreat for touch-ups, deep breaths, or strategic disappearances.<br/><br/>There's an undercover car spot (rare as hen's teeth) and a storage nook for the things you swore you'd use again, from the bread maker to the NutriBullet to the yoga mat curled up like a stale taco.<br/><br/>And being tucked at the rear of the complex? Translation: peace. Until you're the one hosting, in which case the noise complaint's a shared responsibility.<br/><br/>Step outside and it only gets better. Yarra strolls at the end of the street, Glenferrie Road cafés when you want bustle, Richmond nights when you don't want to go home.<br/><br/>This isn't just an address. It's the place plans are made, evenings stretch out, and weekends have a habit of starting earlier than you meant them to.<br/><br/>Finer Details<br/>Owners Corp: $4,160 per annum (approx.)<br/>Council Rates: $1,280 per annum (approx.)<br/>Water Rates: $791 per annum (approx.)<br/>Internal Size: 91sqm (approx.)<br/>No. in Block: 1 of 23<br/>Year Built: 1967<br/>Rental Appraisal: $700-$750 per week (approx.)<br/>Owner Occ: 70%<br/>Title: Strata<br/>Deposit: 10%<br/>Settlement: 30-60 days<br/><br/>Nearby Amenities<br/>Primary School Zone: Glenferrie Primary School & Hawthorn West Primary School<br/>Secondary School Zone: Richmond High School & Melbourne Girls College<br/>Closest Supermarket: Ritchies Hawthorn Square (450m)<br/>Closest Train Station: Hawthorn Station (600m)<br/>Closest Tram: No. 75 (100m) & 70 (180m)<br/>Closest Park: Morang Road Reserve (400m)","established","sold","apartment",,,,,,"Hawthorn","-37.82566","145.025419","3122","3122","true","Vic","21/174 Power Street","Vic","Hawthorn","Bathrooms: 1","bathrooms","1","Bedrooms: 2","bedrooms","2","Parking Spaces: 1","parkingSpaces","1","Open Spaces: 1",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outdoor Features","outdoor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/52f99b0eba7ed8d4184154fada64004bec9c8f2fb84b65d5fe241f28db55d4f4/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/7614156ca6ca89219a20f19c5c50670b7358efd537cded754cf73b343a908bf5/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/f64557c17f7ffe87873bcd7aede0eab9234fcba84bda383f817f0914744954ae/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/adee8adf6c07ddcbfd84aea291be2052609ac663178229204200fc92f8986c42/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/41868848dfca8d570c93888049fdf8aa1ba7b2f66a7edb6543dc8bd1ed75e345/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/a6698834bb0507fb282507524a182e771124abff961eb4890c5b43655994f6eb/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/6ba6b3481bb8fc88dc4712603c14e0c6d5bdffea07c2c0d163ced0220b2c55d2/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/e5ef559edaf92835311511f5e6178effe642200412f77217800975bb28ee96ba/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/1683caad20ff76046db523b78dadd4490e4e2c41b218ae179ad23c67bf5d61a6/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/bb41bc08f2c84959f492f12392a72dc31b01ba0214213dd5c8082b93a5ccb79d/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/0bfe69fa938bdc426a28f260f0dcf0963a3e2134d838e940f9e6e937e8211183/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/0d391299603693d78dc737ff16ac50c24d37c32a4207857eb3cf8a580832e328/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/9a78dfc4ada09737ee3625444dfb4d302a5119b505b022a42fb13362fd8fd4f1/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/32b872043894380826f748349c5bfba53fb0cecfc60eb22ff16241ab27dca3e5/image.jpg",,,"floorplan","true","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/467c18e0dfd7464fe34dae442337deb54f89195aa9209700ca84c0af2e5731c1/image.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11 Sep 2025","2025-09-11","Sold","sold","https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/the-agency-victoria-ANIFZC","https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/the-agency-victoria-ANIFZC?template=webview","3142","VIC","Vic Head Office | Level 3/489 Toorak Road","Toorak","ANIFZC","true","#282828","#ffffff","conciergemelbourne@theagency.com.au","large","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/170x32/ccd1f8e2a34dc7e6049557c0265c45d1851f80e3b53f410154d571c7a389198f/logo.jpg","default","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/160x30/ccd1f8e2a34dc7e6049557c0265c45d1851f80e3b53f410154d571c7a389198f/logo.jpg","small","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/114x21/ccd1f8e2a34dc7e6049557c0265c45d1851f80e3b53f410154d571c7a389198f/logo.jpg","hero image","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/1536x800/991c9bc242fcd76e13f8320b80d14b5a913bd2c72ee454a40146fc00f4124b46/main.jpg","/160x30/ccd1f8e2a34dc7e6049557c0265c45d1851f80e3b53f410154d571c7a389198f/logo.jpg","/1536x800/991c9bc242fcd76e13f8320b80d14b5a913bd2c72ee454a40146fc00f4124b46/main.jpg","/170x32/ccd1f8e2a34dc7e6049557c0265c45d1851f80e3b53f410154d571c7a389198f/logo.jpg","/114x21/ccd1f8e2a34dc7e6049557c0265c45d1851f80e3b53f410154d571c7a389198f/logo.jpg","The Agency - Victoria"," 03 8578 0388","http://www.theagency.com.au","https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/2695698","https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/webview/2695698","833e5a0b-2624-459b-9fc9-3fd1345b3866","lukesaville@theagency.com.au,capture@theagencyvictoria.agentboxmail.com.au","2695698","Property Partner","main photo","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/1462eb22c46c2d025c54296f703a1e7b83cdbdbc2eb2cdf8aacad82c74cb4e2b/main.jpg","0437720806","Luke Saville","0437720806","true","http://www.theagency.com.au","","148810304","true","false","signature",,

,"Space, Light And Lifestyle Combined","$405,000","Set in a boutique block, this ground-floor apartment is all about ease, with enough room to stretch out and invite people over without it feeling like a squeeze.<br/><br/>The living and dining room is bigger than you’d expect, with white brick feature walls and windows that let the light pour in. The kitchen is bright, generously sized, and ready to handle both a quick breakfast and a relaxed dinner with friends. The bedroom enjoys leafy outlooks, built-in robes, space for a king-sized bed and the kind of calm that makes weekend sleep-ins very possible. The separate bathroom features a shower-over-bath, vanity cupboards and drawers, and a laundry trough. A split-system air conditioner, covered car space and communal clothesline add even more appeal to the mix. <br/><br/>Step outside and you’ve got Hawthorn’s best on foot. A quick wander to Glenferrie Road for coffee, groceries or a cheeky wine, trams and trains that get you into the city without thinking about traffic, and Central Gardens when you want green space. Swinburne Uni is nearby if study’s on the cards, and the Yarra’s walking and cycling trails are close enough to make exercise feel less like a chore.<br/><br/>This one’s not just about buying an apartment; it’s about landing a lifestyle that works now and well into the future.<br/><br/>We donate a portion of our fee from every property transaction to the Woodards Foundation to support people experiencing homelessness, family violence and social isolation.","established","sold","apartment",,,,,,"Hawthorn","-37.819224","145.03828","3122","3122","true","Vic","3/28 Liddiard Street","Vic","Hawthorn","Bathrooms: 1","bathrooms","1","Bedrooms: 1","bedrooms","1","Parking Spaces: 1","parkingSpaces","1","Garage: 1",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outdoor Features","outdoor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/dade3586ea492995510432a3d9bf7f85e9f69e4ea90485a292c6961ba3b9dd42/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/3f63b0d5bf8914a0e652d44e9276196e9c144ce5a0a33e2d8ccb41aca7fd67e3/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/08ca40de9ae3df90101642a6943c88ae4816fbf0c7611e986bbe7a198f1f1972/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/d4f3595d7c62ef40195aa0e7a93980c9ec78f7bc80a007f8c5398488343c830e/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/70d1f9ebbc418fac7bc0097d36cbc54a8a69c26f25e5aecd3bfcca2c968d0f64/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/537c87db8151e2185f36763fffffc5b618fcf87ec40316c14450321ec5920b57/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/aefdb804566020d971b1ce83945756f49963187eb4618409040f02065826e658/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/519bf2e05f11fe33a489fa599bef1d75c2ab59d0c7b6c96202ca5d9502a1cf6a/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/db4cb8ec07f70890230111665c3017612cb71f0302154e50502133502cceae99/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/c5fb99c416b8d3c1a540451e1fc7a6e7f5ada6825061b3722b7b5e7c019d237f/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/82d369bd9dd19a66f0e8f4d10d4218455d9310b7c7b1558e048727003fa29566/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/1ae95ae4e8a0e5977940aee9685d98937662ed57301c390608b44bff0bdaabb2/image.jpg",,,"floorplan","true","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/954e5c736aa1f5c3be925593bb9dfd2d3b03560d9db8dc146bbc754ee54d3feb/image.gif",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"03 Sep 2025","2025-09-03","Sold","sold","https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/woodards-camberwell-XPLCAM","https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/woodards-camberwell-XPLCAM?template=webview","3124","VIC","277 Camberwell Road","Camberwell","XPLCAM","true","#001535","#ffffff","camberwell@woodards.com.au","large","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/170x32/d9a2c1b627a9bbffce083bf60aa4389a3cbb9baf840c75bf78134bce0876518e/logo.jpg","default","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/160x30/d9a2c1b627a9bbffce083bf60aa4389a3cbb9baf840c75bf78134bce0876518e/logo.jpg","small","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/114x21/d9a2c1b627a9bbffce083bf60aa4389a3cbb9baf840c75bf78134bce0876518e/logo.jpg","hero image","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/1536x800/db6d65242fc62d43b98eb650e86a916fb3b3c5eed530ebbd9fbd59a560d2cdb8/main.jpg","/160x30/d9a2c1b627a9bbffce083bf60aa4389a3cbb9baf840c75bf78134bce0876518e/logo.jpg","/1536x800/db6d65242fc62d43b98eb650e86a916fb3b3c5eed530ebbd9fbd59a560d2cdb8/main.jpg","/170x32/d9a2c1b627a9bbffce083bf60aa4389a3cbb9baf840c75bf78134bce0876518e/logo.jpg","/114x21/d9a2c1b627a9bbffce083bf60aa4389a3cbb9baf840c75bf78134bce0876518e/logo.jpg","Woodards - Camberwell","03 9805 1111","http://www.woodards.com.au","https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/3569468","https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/webview/3569468","a26422d1-9d41-4d03-8675-9ab4d7196647","jwu@woodards.com.au","3569468","Licensed Estate Agent","main photo","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/8b4f688b310e9419062bdb4d9c120a597548cf110427f0d2f06b2fee06544368/main.jpg","0450880186","Jason Wu","0450880186","true","http://www.woodards.com.au","","148758772","true","false","signature",,

,"Deco Charm with Palm-Lined Calm","$930,000","Think soaring ceilings, polished details, and a floorplan that breathes like a Sunday sleep-in.<br/><br/>Art Deco ceilings so high they qualify for oxygen masks, with original floorboards and a stone fireplace that whispers ""you should be wearing slippers and drinking pinot.""<br/><br/>Set on the ground floor of a block of six. Not sixty. Not six hundred. Just a tight-knit little group where ""strata meeting"" means someone nodding at the bins once a year.<br/><br/>Two huge bedrooms with plantation shutters and double brick walls. Perfect if one of you snores like a leaf blower and the other owns noise-cancelling trauma.<br/><br/>The kitchen's had a full facelift and now looks like she summered in Europe. Stone benches. Gas cooking. Storage for your cookware, your shame, and at least one wildly unnecessary piece of Le Creuset. That stained glass window? She's the main character now.<br/><br/>The bathroom's been fully redone, but still knows where it came from. It's giving fresh tile energy with just a whisper of Gatsby.<br/><br/>A dedicated home office with two built-in desks sits just off the entry, ideal for back-to-back Zoom calls or one of you pretending to work while online shopping.<br/><br/>Separate laundry? Huge. It doubles as a home for your bike, golf clubs, and your ""I swear I'll use it again"" camping gear.<br/><br/>There's also a very deep hallway storage cupboard, the kind that actually fits things, not just dreams and disappointment.<br/><br/>Deck out the back? Absolutely. Ideal for summer barbecues, lazy Sunday brunches, or low-effort ""we should catch up"" hosting.

,"Warehouse elegance & lifestyle edge in fabulous Fitzroy","$2,005,000","Tucked within a tightly held, impeccably maintained Warehouse conversion on one of Fitzroy’s most desirable streets, this stylishly renovated residence delivers the ultimate lock-and-leave lifestyle with generous proportions, serene privacy and an unmistakable sense of ease, moments from Brunswick Street’s café culture, leafy parks, and city-bound transport.<br/><br/>An inviting front lounge with commanding high ceilings and exposed brickwork flows to a sleek contemporary kitchen with stone benchtops, quality integrated appliances including dual ovens and a generous walk-in pantry with wine fridge. A sun-drenched dining and living domain open onto an undercover terrace—blurring the lines between indoor/outdoor flow in the most elegant fashion, perfectly primed for entertaining on both a large and intimate scale.<br/><br/>Upstairs, two oversized bedrooms are set apart for complete privacy, each with their own walk-in robes and direct bathroom access—one with a full ensuite and the other adjoining the central main bathroom with designer tiling and fixtures. A generous study nook adds further flexibility, perfect for working from home, and double-height voids enhance the home’s scale and light, plus generous storage throughout and secure off-street parking via lower-level basement parking. <br/><br/>Immaculately presented and surrounded by wonderful long-term neighbours, this is a true statement of low-maintenance luxury—whether as a refined home base, sophisticated city-edge retreat, or long-term investment in lifestyle excellence. A rare opportunity to enjoy extra-spacious living in one of Melbourne’s most tightly held lifestyle pockets, just metres from the buzz of Brunswick Street and the serenity of Carlton Gardens, plus every city-fringe amenity within easy reach: cafés, restaurants, boutiques, salons, trams, and parklands all just footsteps away!","established","sold","apartment",,,,,,"Fitzroy","-37.80131445","144.97639161","3065","3065","true","Vic","6/55-59 Moor Street","Vic","Fitzroy","Bathrooms: 2","bathrooms","2","Bedrooms: 2","bedrooms","2","Parking Spaces: 1","parkingSpaces","1","Carport: 1",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outdoor Features","outdoor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/67f758c5ce1592e0a53d918778c144371f89cacfdfe5e2e59c96fee4d9e600f8/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/a822f6dc71a0415690a609c2a0a40114b568864fe293def9a99afe47cc84a23a/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/93a88ae01029b26329e8b7a110aad6bd81c4054c15e8f531d833445ccd9544c7/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/712e788524887aa4ce83cbf4835ab102660dbcc6effda534d6b6d88599cc73b3/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/9b0f8ec9fc36e2f145a0c40d5f8c58f856836076d95030f7cfc55821ec4f08e9/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/00490516bd5a70d113edc02d1a024b760934e5ae5ac9d6320c53ec91cefa8f52/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/6b6e1720b3018a2092dc58fc22451c5404dffcd89281e82a1a511e1e99cbbe1e/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/6e1084ebf341eca294c532d7c6e856884f9b01db1a6190453a9c6e6e41f6df95/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/48540d73b40b98e30e8bf27ae6cdddfa199290fd30e9a5430004fab18ab0cf27/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/8c4ad08ff3f1b048b796b19960350c9859a41c55e05b22d451512ecf5b0a4411/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/f25ec15cbedce879e2c123f945ed16e2e6825ffc2991ab115c488df01c7420bd/image.jpg",,,"photo",,"https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/1d9f3e8c9d5d28c704ab19f9b178cc4c35c4f8967a6d9d01168637bc8b356726/image.jpg",,,"floorplan","true","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/4c32312387318ee52d5a0dab4758a2a226fd6265b26a1a6bf22daa4c276cce27/image.gif",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"10 May 2025","2025-05-10","Sold","sold","https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/nelson-alexander-fitzroy-XNXFIU","https://www.realestate.com.au/agency/nelson-alexander-fitzroy-XNXFIU?template=webview","3065","VIC","179 Johnston Street","Fitzroy","XNXFIU","true","#1e0f14","#ffffff","PCarlesso@nelsonalexander.com.au","large","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/170x32/7ad71cc2b9acd29ff16281a017e44bdd8f8b5762aacd2b19107e6b54e5c726e4/logo.jpg","default","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/160x30/7ad71cc2b9acd29ff16281a017e44bdd8f8b5762aacd2b19107e6b54e5c726e4/logo.jpg","small","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/114x21/7ad71cc2b9acd29ff16281a017e44bdd8f8b5762aacd2b19107e6b54e5c726e4/logo.jpg","hero image","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/1536x800/a39d2cc08195103415e63ac10c21338ce4439f2b605bfe0760bd3e22609458eb/main.jpg","/160x30/7ad71cc2b9acd29ff16281a017e44bdd8f8b5762aacd2b19107e6b54e5c726e4/logo.jpg","/1536x800/a39d2cc08195103415e63ac10c21338ce4439f2b605bfe0760bd3e22609458eb/main.jpg","/170x32/7ad71cc2b9acd29ff16281a017e44bdd8f8b5762aacd2b19107e6b54e5c726e4/logo.jpg","/114x21/7ad71cc2b9acd29ff16281a017e44bdd8f8b5762aacd2b19107e6b54e5c726e4/logo.jpg","Nelson Alexander - Fitzroy","03 9417 1956","http://www.nelsonalexander.com.au/?utm_medium=aggs","https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/338506","https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/webview/338506","6b828029-4e5b-49d8-85ae-267996f1bb54","talexiadis@nelsonalexander.com.au","338506","Partner / Auctioneer","main photo","https://i3.au.reastatic.net","/38c0caea73c0b0d2dd3ec569771038418355c12af6fa0717e5f7a2a3278ca2b8/main.jpg","0417030452","Tom Alexiadis","0417030452","true","http://www.nelsonalexander.com.au/?utm_medium=aggs","","147733900","true","false","signature",,

to the Legend Park Estate.<br/><br/>Elevated and discreetly located at the rear of the top floor, the palatial master suite, incorporating parent’s retreat is a sanctuary of privacy with breathtaking outlooks, over Drummies Bridge Reserve & Monash Pony Club, taking full advantage of its parkland position along The Dandenong Creek Tail.<br/><br/>School zoning for top performing Camelot Rise Primary and Highvale Secondary College zone (STSA) adds to the appeal for families looking for all the magic of a modern mansion in a well-serviced part of Glen Waverley.<br/> The premium ‘Valletta’ design

entertaining wing.<br/><br/>Contemporary dark joinery and Euro Smeg appliances in both the main kitchen and butler’s pantry create first-class cooking stations, flowing around a spectacular island bench.<br/><br/>This luminous room is the hero of the floor plan – a light-filled nucleus alongside a panoramic outdoor room with park views, and a back gate to the nature reserve.<br/><br/>King sized bedrooms, walk in robes with dressing mirrors, a wide staircase with picture window, double glazing throughout, clever laundry chute, and bathrooms with wall-to-wall showers showcase the attention to detail of the ‘Reserve’ build. <br/> A triple garage , bluestone paving, Sir Walter Buffalo lawn and screening trees ready to add privacy along the fence ensure the ‘outdoor’ is as sophisticated as the ‘indoor’. <br/><br/>Alive with birdlife, this contemporary wonderland in its green wedge location has you close to The Glen, Capital Reserve, Eastlink, private education at Wesley, PLC and Caufield Grammar, so you can move your family to the upper echelons of family living in the leafy east.","established","sold","house","654 m&sup2;","654 m²","654 m²","m2","654","Glen

,"Cottage Character, Gorgeous Light, Mount View & GWSC (STSA)","$1,404,000","Families wanting entry into the prized school zone for Mount View Primary and Glen Waverley Secondary College (STSA) are going to love this radiant retreat. Designed with the cottage character of a bay window and a pretty porch along the street frontage, the family sized setting surprises with its house-sized configuration.<br/><br/>The free-flowing living rooms face north for gorgeous light through the European windows, drawing you across the connected lounge, family room, kitchen and side deck.<br/><br/>It’s a luminous space that feels made for relaxation, while the zoned bedrooms offer quiet retreat in the back corner.<br/><br/>A private master bedroom has its own side door to the garden, an 8-door robe, ensuite with a spacious shower, and plenty of that beautiful natural light that distinguishes the home.<br/><br/>The solar panels are perfectly positioned to take full advantage of their north-facing orientation<br/><br/>Imagine the joy of cooking in a bright kitchen with its own breakfast bar – the perfect antidote to the morning rush.<br/><br/>Mount View Primary school is an easy 4 minute walk, close enough to leave the car at home and skip the school pick up stress.<br/><br/>The superbly located unit also offers the advantage of a double garage with secure internal access, plus extra car parking on the independent driveway, new carpets, tiled walkways and a full laundry.<br/><br/>With a new build under way next door, it’s easy to see why Gallaghers Rd remains a hot spot, right amid the school and shopping hub of Glen Waverley, and its coming 90km Suburban Rail Link which will elevate the suburb even further for its train access between Box Hill and Cheltenham.","established","sold","unit","392 m&sup2;","392
