    "**Dataset:** `dataset_realestate.csv` (scraped from realestate.com.au)  \n",
    "**Goal:** Build and evaluate regression models to predict Melbourne housing prices and **exceed** the Distinction requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this notebook does (HD targets):**\n",
    "- Code‑driven **data preprocessing** with an **audit log** (transparent & reproducible)\n",
    "- Clear **EDA** with short **interpretations**\n",
    "- Compare ≥3 **regression models** via **5‑fold CV** using **MAE, RMSE, R²**\n",
    "- **Permutation importance** for interpretability\n",
    "- **Error analysis** by suburb/property type\n",
    "- Tiny **Streamlit demo** for deployment screenshots\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping to Assignment Requirements\n",
    "1) **Data acquisition**: Uses your scraped dataset (≥150 points across 3 suburbs).  \n",
    "2) **Preprocessing & EDA**: Cleaning, engineered features (distance to CBD, price per m²), visuals + commentary.  \n",
    "3) **Model development**: ≥3 models, **k‑fold CV**, metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²).  \n",
    "4) **Feature importance**: Model‑agnostic ranking (permutation importance).  \n",
    "5) **Deployment**: Minimal Streamlit app; take a screenshot for your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Tip: After each figure/table, paste the printed **Insight** line into your report and cross‑reference the figure number.\n"
